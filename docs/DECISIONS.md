# Decisions log

Per CLAUDE.md: when a spec section is ambiguous, or a construct requires an
engine-level judgment call the spec doesn't pin down, it's logged here
instead of silently picked. New assumption-registry defaults are flagged
here too, for Satya's sign-off.

## 2026-08-11 -- Stage 1 (normalise.py), Part C SS C.4.1

### 1. `upi_category_mix` default weights -- NEW ASSUMPTION, needs sign-off

C.4.1 says the UPI aggregate decomposes "using the registry's
`upi_category_mix` default (grocery-heavy; editable)" but Part C never
states the actual weights -- C.7's registry section doesn't list them either.
I introduced a default (`engine/normalise.py::DEFAULT_UPI_CATEGORY_MIX`):

| Category | Weight |
|---|---|
| Grocery | 38% |
| Ecommerce | 15% |
| Dining | 12% |
| Utilities | 10% |
| Offline retail | 10% |
| Fuel | 8% |
| Entertainment | 7% |

Grocery-heavy per the spec's steer, shaped loosely around typical Indian
UPI P2M usage (kirana/grocery dominant, followed by food & ecommerce). This
is a guess, not sourced data -- please review and edit.

### 2. C.7's "UPI (small-ticket): Rs 350" row -- left unused, flagging the ambiguity

C.7's ticket-size table has a row "UPI (small-ticket) -- Rs 350" alongside
the category rows (Grocery Rs 700, Dining Rs 600, etc.). But C.4.1's
decomposition maps the UPI aggregate into real spend categories (grocery,
ecommerce, ...) via `upi_category_mix` -- there is no category literally
named "UPI" for that row to attach to once decomposition happens.

Two readings:
  (a) The row is vestigial/unused once decomposition maps to real
      categories -- each UPI-derived segment uses its *category's* normal
      ticket size (grocery UPI spend uses Rs 700, same as non-UPI grocery).
  (b) UPI-channel segments should use Rs 350 as the ticket size *regardless
      of category*, reflecting that UPI transactions run smaller than
      card-swipe transactions even within the same category (a UPI kirana
      payment vs. a supermarket card swipe).

**Implemented (a)** for Stage 1, since C.4.1 only specifies channel tagging
(`channel: upi, decomposition: assumed`) and category decomposition, not a
ticket-size override. Reading (b) would matter to Stage 4's rounding maths
(smaller ticket = more rounding loss per rupee) -- if that's the intent,
this needs a one-line change: UPI-channel segments look up a fixed Rs 350
instead of `ticket_sizes[category]`. **Please confirm which reading is
correct.**

### 3. Rounding/reconciliation convention (implementation detail, not a
business assumption -- noted for the audit trail, not sign-off)

Every allocation (month split, category split) must sum exactly to its
input total -- no rupee created or lost. Where proportional rounding leaves
a paisa-level residual, it's pushed onto the *last slot with a nonzero
weight* (last month with spend, or last category in the UPI mix). This is
an arbitrary-but-deterministic choice among several valid ones (e.g.
largest-remainder distribution); it only ever affects the last paisa or two
of a monthly figure, never the annual total.

## 2026-08-11 -- Stage 3 (match.py), Part C SS C.2.1 / SS C.2.6

### 4. Geography-scoped selectors not yet matchable -- gap, not a choice

C.9 Example 8 (syn_travel) has an earning rule selector
`{"geography": "international"}` (2x points on international spend). Stage
1's category-mode grid (category, channel, month, amount) carries no
geography dimension, so Stage 2 (eligibility.py) and Stage 3 (match.py)
both reject any selector naming `geography` (or `mcc_include`/`mcc_exclude`/
`networks`/`txn_min`/`txn_max`/`date_from`/`date_to`) rather than silently
treating it as "always matches" or "never matches" -- either would produce
wrong numbers without saying so.

This means syn_travel's "intl" rule cannot be evaluated yet. It isn't
blocking today's Stage 3 scope (syn_points/syn_ecom/syn_fuel don't need
geography), but it **will** block the golden battery once syn_travel needs
a golden scenario, and it will block real international-spend cards during
Phase 5 ingestion. Fix is additive when it's needed: give `CategorySpend`
(Stage 1) an optional `geography` field the same way `channel` and
`merchant_group` work today, thread it onto `SpendSegment`, then Stage 2/3
can drop `geography` from their unsupported-field lists. Flagging now so
it's on the record before it becomes a blocker.

### 5. `SpendSegment.merchant_group` -- new field, Stage 1 doesn't populate it yet

Stage 3 needs to match `merchant_groups` selectors (syn_points' portal
bonus, C.9 Example 3), but Stage 1's `SpendSegment` only carried category/
channel/month/amount/ticket_size. Added `merchant_group: str | None = None`
to the dataclass (backward compatible -- all existing construction is by
keyword, confirmed by grep before editing; Stage 1/2's 24 existing tests
still pass unchanged).

`normalise()` itself is unchanged and does not populate this field --
there's no input path yet for a user to declare "Rs X of my spend was at
merchant group Y" the way `CategorySpend.channel` lets them declare a
channel. Stage 3's own tests construct `SpendSegment` directly with
`merchant_group` set, bypassing `normalise()`, the same pattern Stage 2's
tests already used for fields Stage 1 doesn't produce. Wiring a real input
path through Stage 1 is deferred until a card actually needs it end-to-end
through the full pipeline (same "additive when needed" posture as #4).
